# usually generated by makeindex, which needs an appropriate .ist file to over-ride the MakeIndex defaults that produce indexes.
# .glg ... denotes a MakeIndex glossary log file.
# .idx	If your document contains an index. LaTeX stores all the words that go into the index in this file. Process this file with makeindex.
# .ilg	Logfile telling what makeindex did.

# # Python
# .py: This is normally the input source code that you've written.
# .pyc: This is the compiled bytecode. If you import a module, python will build a *.pyc file that contains the bytecode to make importing it again later easier (and faster).
# .pyo: This is a *.pyc file that was created while optimizations (-O) was on.
# .pyd: This is basically a windows dll file. http://docs.python.org/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll
